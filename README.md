**Fork Notice:**  
This repository is a fork of [Wh0am123/MCP-Kali-Server](https://github.com/Wh0am123/MCP-Kali-Server).  
While it inherits the original structure and features, this fork will evolve in a **new direction**, focusing on expanded AI integrations, multi-agent orchestration, and extended security automation.

**Purpose of the Fork:**  
- Modernize and extend AI-assisted penetration testing capabilities.  
- Introduce more flexible MCP server integrations (HuggingFace, GitHub, Notion).  
- Improve automation for CTF challenges, recon, and exploitation workflows.  
- Maintain schema-compliant MCP client/server interaction while enhancing functionality.

---

## 🔍 Use Case

The original MCP functionality allowed AI-driven offensive security testing by:  

- Interacting with AI endpoints like OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, or other models.  
- Exposing an API to execute commands on a Kali Linux machine.  
- Automating recon, exploitation, and solving CTF web challenges.  
- Sending custom requests (e.g., curl, nmap, ffuf) and receiving structured outputs.  

**This fork will expand the direction of the project to include:**  

- Enhanced automation for security workflows beyond standard terminal commands.  
- Extended integrations with additional AI models and services.  
- Improved orchestration for multi-agent scenarios and collaborative testing.  
- Streamlined pipelines for penetration testing, CTF solving, and ethical hacking exercises.

---

## 🚀 Features

The original repository included:

- 🧠 **AI Endpoint Integration:** Connect Kali to any MCP client like Claude Desktop or 5ire.  
- 🖥️ **Command Execution API:** Controlled API to execute terminal commands on Kali Linux.  
- 🕸️ **Web Challenge Support:** AI-assisted interaction with web apps, APIs, and capture of flags.  
- 🔐 **Designed for Offensive Security Professionals:** Ideal for red teamers, bug bounty hunters, or CTF players automating common tasks.  

**Future features in this fork will focus on:**  

- Multi-agent orchestration and intelligent task delegation.  
- Integration with cloud-based AI endpoints and model pipelines.  
- Enhanced logging, analytics, and structured output for automation workflows.  
- Additional security tooling, including forensic and analysis utilities.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Kali Linux (recommended) or any Linux distribution
- **Python:** 3.11 or higher
- **Docker:** (optional) for containerized deployment

### Method 1: Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/canstralian/forked-u-MCP-Kali-Server.git
cd forked-u-MCP-Kali-Server

# Build and run with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# Or build and run manually
docker build -t mcp-kali-server .
docker run -p 5000:5000 mcp-kali-server
```

### Method 2: Installation from Source

**On the Linux machine (API Server):**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/canstralian/forked-u-MCP-Kali-Server.git
cd forked-u-MCP-Kali-Server

# Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Run the server
python3 kali_server.py
```

**On your MCP Client (Windows or Linux):**

```bash
python3 /absolute/path/to/mcp_server.py --server http://LINUX_IP:5000
```

### Method 3: Development Installation

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/canstralian/forked-u-MCP-Kali-Server.git
cd forked-u-MCP-Kali-Server

# Install with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest -v

# Run linters
flake8 .
pylint kali_server.py mcp_server.py
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file from `.env.example`:

```bash
# API Server Configuration
API_PORT=5000
DEBUG_MODE=0
COMMAND_TIMEOUT=180

# MCP Server Configuration
KALI_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=300
```

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Edit `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kali_mcp": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/mcp_server.py",
        "--server",
        "http://LINUX_IP:5000/"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 5ire Desktop Application

Add an MCP with the command:
```bash
python3 /absolute/path/to/mcp_server.py http://LINUX_IP:5000
```

The app will generate the needed configuration automatically.

## 📖 Usage

### Available Tools

The MCP server provides access to the following security tools:

- **Network Scanning:** nmap
- **Directory Enumeration:** gobuster, dirb
- **Web Scanning:** nikto, wpscan, sqlmap
- **Password Cracking:** hydra, john
- **SMB Enumeration:** enum4linux
- **Exploitation Framework:** metasploit

### Example Commands

Through your MCP client (like Claude Desktop), you can use natural language:

```
"Run an nmap scan on 192.168.1.1"
"Use gobuster to enumerate directories on http://example.com"
"Check http://example.com for SQL injection vulnerabilities"
"Crack the hashes in /path/to/hashfile using john"
```

### API Endpoints

Direct API usage:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Execute nmap scan
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/tools/nmap \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target": "192.168.1.1", "scan_type": "quick"}'

# Run custom command
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/command \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command": "whoami"}'
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest test_basic.py -v
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This tool executes system commands and should be deployed with extreme caution.

### Best Practices

1. **Never expose to public internet** without authentication
2. **Use in isolated networks** or behind VPN/firewall
3. **Run with minimal privileges** (not as root)
4. **Review logs regularly** for suspicious activity
5. **Keep dependencies updated** (`pip-audit`, `safety check`)

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for comprehensive security guidelines.
