# Security Policy

## Overview

The MCP Kali Server is designed for **educational and ethical security testing purposes only**. This document outlines security considerations, best practices, and vulnerability reporting procedures.

## Intended Use

✅ **Authorized Uses:**
- Educational and learning purposes
- Authorized penetration testing with proper permissions
- Security research in controlled environments
- CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions
- Red team exercises with explicit authorization

❌ **Prohibited Uses:**
- Unauthorized access to systems or networks
- Malicious activities or exploitation
- Deployment on production systems without proper security controls
- Any illegal activities

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

⚠️ **Important:** The current version (v0.1.0) does **NOT** include built-in authentication.

**Recommendations:**
- Deploy behind a reverse proxy with authentication (nginx, Apache)
- Use network-level security (firewall rules, VPN)
- Never expose directly to the public internet
- Implement API keys or OAuth if exposing externally
- Consider integration with existing authentication systems

### 2. Input Validation

All API endpoints should validate input to prevent:
- Command injection attacks
- Path traversal vulnerabilities
- SQL injection (if database is used)
- Malformed requests causing crashes

**Current implementation includes:**
- Basic parameter validation
- Required field checks
- Type validation

**Recommendations for production:**
- Implement strict input sanitization
- Use allowlists for command parameters
- Validate file paths against directory traversal
- Limit command execution scope

### 3. Network Security

**Best Practices:**
- Run on isolated network segments
- Use firewall rules to restrict access
- Enable HTTPS/TLS for production deployments
- Consider VPN or SSH tunneling for remote access
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies

### 4. Privilege Management

**Container Deployment:**
- Dockerfile runs as non-root user (mcpuser)
- Minimal system permissions

**Direct Installation:**
- Avoid running as root unless absolutely necessary
- Use dedicated service account with minimal privileges
- Apply principle of least privilege

### 5. Secrets Management

**Never commit sensitive data to version control:**
- API keys
- Passwords
- Tokens
- Private keys
- Database credentials

**Use environment variables or secrets management:**
- Create `.env` file from `.env.example`
- Use Docker secrets for container deployments
- Consider tools like HashiCorp Vault for production
- Rotate credentials regularly

### 6. Command Execution Risks

The server executes system commands, which poses inherent risks:

**Mitigations:**
- Commands execute with timeout limits
- Output is captured and logged
- Subprocess isolation
- Resource limits can be configured

**Additional recommendations:**
- Implement command allowlisting
- Audit all command executions
- Monitor for suspicious patterns
- Set up alerts for dangerous operations

### 7. Logging & Monitoring

**Current logging includes:**
- Request logging
- Error tracking
- Command execution results

**Best practices:**
- Enable detailed logging in production
- Store logs securely
- Implement log rotation
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Regular security audits of logs

### 8. Dependency Security

**Regular maintenance required:**
```bash
# Check for vulnerable dependencies
pip-audit

# Update dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Security scanning
bandit -r .
```

**CI/CD includes:**
- CodeQL security scanning
- Automated dependency checks

## Deployment Recommendations

### Development Environment
```bash
# Use with local network only
python3 kali_server.py --port 5000
```

### Production Environment
1. **Use Docker with security hardening**
2. **Enable HTTPS/TLS**
3. **Implement authentication**
4. **Set up monitoring and logging**
5. **Regular security updates**
6. **Network isolation**

### Docker Security
```bash
# Run with read-only filesystem where possible
docker run --read-only -v /tmp:/tmp:rw mcp-kali-server

# Limit resources
docker run --memory="512m" --cpus="1.0" mcp-kali-server

# Drop capabilities
docker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE mcp-kali-server
```

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT open a public GitHub issue**
2. Email the maintainer at: [Provide email]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Assessment:** Within 1 week
- **Fix Development:** Based on severity
- **Public Disclosure:** After patch is available

### Security Updates

Security patches will be released as soon as possible and announced via:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- CHANGELOG.md
- Release notes

## Security Scanning

### Automated Scans

The project uses:
- **CodeQL:** Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Dependabot:** Automated dependency updates
- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD security checks

### Manual Security Audits

Recommended tools:
```bash
# Python security linter
bandit -r . -f json -o bandit-report.json

# Check dependencies for known vulnerabilities
pip-audit

# Alternative dependency checker
safety check
```
